## CT Data
This folder contains the CT data about the phantom. In particular, you can find two Nifti files representing the entire phantom and a cropped portion of it.
In the [3d_reconstruction](https://github.com/stefanoBazzani/robotic_assisted_pcnl/tree/main/data/ct/3d_reconstruction) folder, you will find the segmentations and reconstructed organs derived from the CT scan.
To visualize these files, we strongl recommend to download and install 3D Slicer from [this page](https://download.slicer.org/).
To open the entire scene, drag and drop the .mrml file into your Slicer app.

Segmentation files can be edited and pre-processed using scripts in [pre_processing](https://github.com/stefanoBazzani/robotic_assisted_pcnl/tree/main/code/scripts/pre_processing) folder.
