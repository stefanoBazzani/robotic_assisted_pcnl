# Robotic Assited PCNL
This repository contains code and file to perform a test of Robotic Assisted Percutaneous Nephrolitotomy.
You will find both sample data and code to replicate tests.
We conducted experiments using a real-anatomy phantom and a *KUKA LWR4+*

## Data
In [data](https://github.com/stefanoBazzani/robotic_assisted_pcnl/tree/main/data) folder you will find both CT scan and Ultrasound images of the phantom we used for the experiments.

## Code
In [code](https://github.com/stefanoBazzani/robotic_assisted_pcnl/tree/main/code) folder you can find the ROS workspace with the GUI and the control algorithm for the robot, as well as the scripts useful for 3D volume pre-processing and trajectory computation.
