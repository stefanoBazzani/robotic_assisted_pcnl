# Robotic-Assisted PCNL

This repository contains the code and data associated with the study *Ultrasonographic-Guided Robotic-Assisted Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy*.  
The goal of this project is to develop a system that assists surgeons in achieving accurate renal access during Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy (PCNL) procedures.

Starting from pre-operative CT scans, anatomical structures are reconstructed to automatically plan a safe and optimal needle trajectory.  
During the intra-operative phase, a collaborative robotic arm — equipped with an ultrasound (US) probe and a needle guide — positions itself to assist the surgeon in aligning the needle along the pre-planned path.

## Data

The [`data`](https://github.com/stefanoBazzani/robotic_assisted_pcnl/tree/main/data) folder includes CT volumes and ultrasound images of the phantom used for experiments and testing.

## Code

The [`code`](https://github.com/stefanoBazzani/robotic_assisted_pcnl/tree/main/code) directory contains scripts for pre-operative needle trajectory planning.
