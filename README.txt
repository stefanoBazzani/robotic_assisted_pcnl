# Robotic Assisted PCNL
This repository contains scripts and date used in the work *Ultrasonographic-Guided Robotic-Assisted Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy*.
This work aims to provide help to a surgeon who needs to perform a renal access during a PCNL surgery.
Starting from pre-operative CT images, we reconstruct interested organs and anatomical parts, plan a safe and optimal trajectory, and exploit a collaborative robotic arm to help the surgeon during the needle insertion.

## Code
In this [folder](https://github.com/stefanoBazzani/robotic_assisted_pcnl/tree/main/code) you can find scripts to perform the pre-operative trajectory planning.

## Data
This [folder](https://github.com/stefanoBazzani/robotic_assisted_pcnl/tree/main/data) contains both CT and US data of the mannequin used during tests and experiments.
